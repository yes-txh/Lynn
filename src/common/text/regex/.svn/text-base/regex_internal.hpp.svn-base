/* When compiling a DLL for Windows, the exported symbols have to be declared
using some MS magic. I found some useful information on this web page:
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y4h7bcy6(VS.80).aspx. According to the
information there, using __declspec(dllexport) without "extern" we have a
definition; with "extern" we have a declaration. The settings here override the
setting in pcre.h. We use:

  REGEX_EXPORT_DECLARE       for declarations
  REGEX_EXPORT_DEFINE       for definitions of exported functions
